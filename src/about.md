# About

<center><img src="meandmacallan.jpg" width="80%"></center>

I'm a software engineer from Scotland. My interests include:

* Building useful data-driven tools and services,
* The interface between data science and production engineering systems,
* Maintaining high quality and testability in data- and ML-enabled products

At present, I'm working on software for power systems instrumentation with [Synaptec](https://synapt.ec).

In a previous life, I worked in engineering research at the [University of Strathclyde](https://www.strath.ac.uk/research/subjects/electronicelectricalengineering/instituteforenergyenvironment/): developing statistical and machine learning methods for reliability in nuclear generation condition monitoring. After an extended write-up period, I successfully defended my thesis in January 2019 and received my doctorate in November of the same year.

I live in the south of Scotland with my family and our Scottish Terrier. When Iâ€™m not writing code, I spend most of my free time reading, training Brazilian jiu-jitsu, and playing/watching golf.
