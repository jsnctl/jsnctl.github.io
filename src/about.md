# About

<center><img src="jsnctl.png" width="100%"></center>

I'm a software engineer from Scotland. My professional interests include:

* Cloud-native tooling and distributed systems,
* Building useful data-driven tools, products, and services,
* Maintaining high quality and testability in data- and ML-enabled products,

At present, I'm an engineer at [Cofide Security](https://cofide.io).

Earlier in my career, I worked in engineering research at the [University of Strathclyde](https://www.strath.ac.uk/research/subjects/electronicelectricalengineering/instituteforenergyenvironment/): developing statistical and machine learning methods for reliability in nuclear generation condition monitoring. After an extended write-up period, I successfully defended [my thesis](https://stax.strath.ac.uk/concern/theses/1j92g746t) in January 2019 and received my doctorate in November of the same year.

I live in the south of Scotland with my family and our Scottish Terrier. When Iâ€™m not writing code, I spend most of my free time reading, training Brazilian jiu-jitsu, and playing/watching golf.
