# About

<center><img src="meandmacallan.jpg" width="80%"></center>

I'm a software engineer from Scotland. My interests include:

* Building useful data-driven tools and services,
* The interface between data science and production engineering systems,
* Maintaining high quality and testability in data- and ML-enabled products

I’m currently building [Hypervector](https://hypervector.io) to help engineers and data scientists have confidence in their production data science and ML assets. Feel free to drop me an email at [jason@hypervector.io](mailto:jason@hypervector.io).

In a previous life, I worked in engineering research at the [University of Strathclyde](https://www.strath.ac.uk/research/subjects/electronicelectricalengineering/instituteforenergyenvironment/): developing statistical and machine learning methods for reliability in nuclear generation condition monitoring. After an extended write-up period, I successfully defended my thesis in January 2019 and received my doctorate in November of the same year.

I live in Glasgow with my family and our Scottish Terrier. When I’m not writing code, I spend most of my free time reading, training Brazilian jiu-jitsu, and playing/watching golf.
